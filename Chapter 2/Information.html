        <p>The Office, popular American television situation comedy series following the daily lives of a group of employees working at the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network from 2005 to 2013. Although The Office received mostly middling ratings while it was on the air, peaking in its fifth season with an average of roughly nine million live and same-day viewers per episode, it later became a streaming-era sensation. The show helped launch the careers of actors Steve Carell, John Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling, among others.</p>
        <p>The Office is a mock documentary, or mockumentary, that aimed to portray “in a realistic style some ordinary American office workers trapped in a confined space with their immature, inappropriate, bizarre, or deluded coworkers and one horribly overconfident supervisor,” according to the casting call distributed for the series’ pilot episode. In order to further its appearance as a documentary, the show was shot with a single-camera setup without a studio audience or laugh track, and reality television veteran cinematographer Randall Einhorn was credited with creating this look. The main action of the show is supplemented by talking-head interviews, or “confessionals,” in which characters speak directly to the camera.</p>
        <p>Producers Ben Silverman and Greg Daniels based The Office on the British situation comedy of the same name created by actors Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant. Gervais and Merchant joined the American production along with Howard Klein as the first season’s executive producers. The pilot episode is nearly a shot-by-shot remake of the British source material. After an underwhelming and short first season, Daniels decided to diverge from the bleak tone of the British series by making Michael Scott more likable than his British counterpart, David Brent (played by Gervais), allowing the American show to develop its own comedic voice.</p>
        <p>Beyond the talent and artistry of the show’s cast and creative team, some critics and members of the show’s production team attribute the show’s success to a confluence of cultural factors present in the mid-to-late 2000s. The Office arrived at NBC right when the most popular situation comedies of the 1990s, including Friends (1994–2004) and Frasier (1993–2004), were wrapping up, and it seemed to audiences that there was nothing new or exciting on network television. The Office, by subverting the aesthetics of reality television during a time when reality television was gaining prominence in the U.S. and applying them to a scripted comedy, was something truly novel in this cultural climate.</p>
        <p>Additionally, there may have been something particular about Michael Scott that spoke to the concerns and preoccupations of many American viewers at the time of the show’s premiere. In Andy Greene’s book The Office: The Untold Story of the Greatest Sitcom of the 2000s (2020), television critic Rob Sheffield described Michael Scott as “the archetypal TV figure of that decade” because of his similarity to then president George W. Bush. The Office began airing during the last years of Bush’s presidency, and as one of the show’s writers, Aaron Shure, noted in Greene’s book, “because Bush was president,” a seemingly clueless boss like Scott spoke to a question that “was sort of [in] the zeitgeist of ‘What does it mean when the people in charge are incompetent?’ ”</p>
