        <h4>Allen Bolina</h4>
        <p>I've been watching TV throughout my entire life, and never in all that time has there been another show as charming, witty, and humorous as "The Office". At first glance, back when I dived into the 1st Season, I don't remember having much interest and recalled some of the jokes falling flat. The characters, on the other hand, had such a unique chemistry with one another, that it was nearly impossible to not get a laugh. By the time of the 2nd Season, the show's true potential really began to take shape. This was when I started to realize how much of an impact this would have on everybody and why they were so ambitious to make memes about it.</p>
        <p>It was the point where we really started to know what each other's motives were, and the solutions they would have in overcoming key moments in their lives. Not only that, but what makes this show so unique, unlike anything I've every seen before is one thing, the cold openings. From the time where Jim pulled off one prank after another on Dwight to the lip dub ensemble at the start of the 7th Season (and who could forget the famous Fire Drill opening), I couldn't remember a single time where I wasn't hanging at the edge of my seat whenever these came on. Literally every step of the way (except for Seasons 8 & 9) had me engaged with the characters and the undeniably quirky-style humor, which is pretty rare to come by these days. I especially admire the fact that this show doesn't utilize a laugh track, which was something that always bothered me when watching run-of-the-mill sitcoms. In this case, whenever there's a funny scene, we know exactly when to laugh without forcing it upon us.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, every show has its fair share of upsides and downsides, and it really took a drastic turn by the start of the 8th Season. Michael Scott, arguably the most iconic character in the series, had left, leading me to question if I was even watching the same show that I've come to love like everyone else. Once in a while, I would still get a few chuckles (especially from Jim and Dwight) and some of these cold openings were pretty creative, but a majority of the new source material felt pretty shallow. This can easily be directed at some of the newer characters, who were only there to serve as underwhelming replacements rather than having an essential role in the story arc. I'm glad that it came to a merciful end with Michael's cameo appearance in the finale. It was one of the most touching moments I've experienced and felt that it was the perfect way to conclude such a breathtaking series.</p>
        <p>A true icon of its time, and still, 15 years after it began taking the world by storm, who knew that a simple concept, revolving around the everyday lives at a Paper Company in Scranton, can become such a timeless phenomenon?</p>

        <p>I'd been having some difficulties in my life and discovered this amazing show on Netflix that helped me escape from the real world, so I took a trip to the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company Scranton branch. The Office is the best sitcom show ever made. Started watching S1 and was hooked from the first episode where they planned to close the Scranton branch. I laughed myself to death watching this series and am currently enjoying S5. I've never written a review for a series or movie before, but after watching until S5, I felt compelled to do so, as this series changed my perspective to look at things in a new light.  After watching this, we will realize that the world is not such a bad place after all, and we will be mature enough to care about those close to us and to move on from our pasts.</p>
        <p>Michael Scott, my favourite character in the film, taught me to be patient with people and to never abandon them no matter what. Also, I learned that relationships come and go, but we should not place our happiness in the hands of others.</p>
        <p>Jim, another favourite character, taught me that there is beauty in living a simple life. He also taught us that while you may not enjoy your first job, it can become your career if you give it a chance. Sometimes jobs like this turn out to be the most rewarding experiences and lead to great things. Take advantage of every opportunity.</p>
        <p>If you've made it this far, I wish you all the best and a happy life.</p>
