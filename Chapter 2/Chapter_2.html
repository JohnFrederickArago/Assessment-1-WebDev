      <h2>Plot</h2>
      <p>This U.S. adaptation -- set at a paper company in Scranton, Pa. -- has a similar documentary style to that of the Ricky Gervais-led British original. It features the Dunder-Mifflin staff, which includes characters based on roles in the British show -- and, quite possibly, people with whom you work in your offifce. There's Jim, the likable employee who's a bit of an everyman. Jim has a thing for receptionist-turned-sales-rep Pam -- because office romances are always a good idea! There's also Dwight, the co-worker who is successful but devoid of social skills and common sense.</p>

      <h2>Information</h2>
      <p>The Office, popular American television situation comedy series following the daily lives of a group of employees working at the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania, that aired on the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) network from 2005 to 2013. Although The Office received mostly middling ratings while it was on the air, peaking in its fifth season with an average of roughly nine million live and same-day viewers per episode, it later became a streaming-era sensation. The show helped launch the careers of actors Steve Carell, John Krasinski, and Mindy Kaling, among others.</p>
      <p>
      The Office is a mock documentary, or mockumentary, that aimed to portray “in a realistic style some ordinary American office workers trapped in a confined space with their immature, inappropriate, bizarre, or deluded coworkers and one horribly overconfident supervisor,” according to the casting call distributed for the series’ pilot episode. In order to further its appearance as a documentary, the show was shot with a single-camera setup without a studio audience or laugh track, and reality television veteran cinematographer Randall Einhorn was credited with creating this look. The main action of the show is supplemented by talking-head interviews, or “confessionals,” in which characters speak directly to the camera.</p>

      <h4>Allen Bolina</h4>
      <p>I've been watching TV throughout my entire life, and never in all that time has there been another show as charming, witty, and humorous as "The Office". At first glance, back when I dived into the 1st Season, I don't remember having much interest and recalled some of the jokes falling flat. The characters, on the other hand, had such a unique chemistry with one another, that it was nearly impossible to not get a laugh. By the time of the 2nd Season, the show's true potential really began to take shape. This was when I started to realize how much of an impact this would have on everybody and why they were so ambitious to make memes about it.</p>
